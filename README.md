# hello-world
My first repo

Description

Hello, this is my first readme inside my first repository. I'm currently 30 years old and I'm on my programming journey and I am at the point where I think I should know how to use GitHub.
I read that there is a typical way to write readme's and so I'm sure I'll pick that up as I go. Sorry if this isn't it. Going forward, I plan on uploading projects that I'm working on, big or small. I see you can contribute to other people's projects. When I'm a little more competent, I'd like to help. Anyway, i'm leaving now to go learn more :)

Happy coding!
